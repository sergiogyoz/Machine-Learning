Variables:

  1   CRIM     per capita crime rate by town 
  2   ZN       proportion of residential land zoned for lots over
               25,000 sq.ft.
  3   INDUS    proportion of non-retail business acres per town
  4   CHAS     Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river;
               0 otherwise)
  5   NOX      nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
  6   RM       average number of rooms per dwelling
  7   AGE      proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
  8   DIS      weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
  9   RAD      index of accessibility to radial highways
 10   TAX      full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
 11   PTRATIO  pupil-teacher ratio by town
 12   B        1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks
               by town
 13   LSTAT    % lower status of the population
 14   MEDV     Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

Order: mysterious

Note: Variable #14 seems to be censored at 50.00 (corresponding to a
median price of $50,000); Censoring is suggested by the fact that the
highest median price of exactly $50,000 is reported in 16 cases, while
15 cases have prices between $40,000 and $50,000, with prices rounded
to the nearest hundred. Harrison and Rubinfeld do not mention any
censoring.
